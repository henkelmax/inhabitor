# Inhabitor

A simple Fabric mod that adds commands to modify the `inhabitedTime` of a range of chunks.

## Commands

`/inhabitor set <x1> <z1> <x2> <z2> <time>`: Sets the `inhabitedTime` of all chunks in the range to the specified time in ticks.

`/inhabitor add <x1> <z1> <x2> <z2> <time>`: Adds the specified time in ticks to the `inhabitedTime` of all chunks in the range.


**NOTE:** This command takes a lot of time to execute, so expect the server to lag while the command is running.
